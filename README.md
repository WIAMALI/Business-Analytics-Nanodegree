# Business-Analytics-Nanodegree
This repository contains projects for Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree program.

This Nanodegree program is designed to help you gain foundational data skills applicable to any industry by collecting and analyzing data, modeling 
business scenarios, and communicating your findings with Excel, SQL, and Tableau.


# Introduction to Data

> This section aims to develop and communicate data insights using descriptive statistics and visualizations in Excel.
> Excel functions, the creation of Excel models, and statistical analysis. 


**Project - Analyze Survey Data

In this project, I explored Udacity marketing surveillance data. 
I analyzed data from over 500 New York Stock Exchange companies using statistics and spreadsheet programs such as Excel. Then, using the NYSE dataset, I
forecast financial metrics based on three different scenarios for a company.



# SQL for Data Analysis

> SQL is used to extract and analyze data sets. To find answers to business questions, use the data gathered from a query result and visualize it to simplify its interpretation. The project in this section is to examine a digital music store to determine how data from their database can benefit the company.

**Project - Query a Digital Music Store Database**

In this project, I will query a database containing information about a digital music store's media, employees, and customers. I plan to use the database 
to assist the store in better understanding the types of music purchased, where customers live, and how the company can improve its business practices.



# Data Visualization

> This section elevates data visualization to a whole new level. Tableau can be used to analyze and visualize large data sets, as well as to create informative and observations dashboards. This section makes it easier to visualize large data sets in a more readable format so that insights can be presented to all business areas.


**Project - Build Data Dashboards**

In this project, I'll use Tableau to create interactive dashboards that will be used to discover and communicate data insights. I'll use a dataset of 
flight delays in the United States to visualize airline and airport quality, find the best times to fly, and more.
