# Business-Analytics-Nanodegree
This repository contains projects for Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree program.

This Nanodegree program is designed to help you gain foundational data skills applicable to any industry by collecting and analyzing data, modeling 
business scenarios, and communicating your findings with Excel, SQL, and Tableau.



Project 1: Analyze Survey Data

In this project, I explored Udacity marketing surveillance data. 
I analyzed data from over 500 New York Stock Exchange companies using statistics and spreadsheet programs such as Excel. Then, using the NYSE dataset, I
forecast financial metrics based on three different scenarios for a company.
